<aside2><p>I love experiencing new things and seeing new places, which is why I love to travel. I enjoy touristy vacations as well as relaxing ones where I can just lay on the beach. My family likes to be adventurous and do fun things, like zip lining in Park City or ATV riding in Puerto Rico. I also love trying new foods and cuisines, and my definite favorite food was in Florencee...such yummy pizza and pasta!!
